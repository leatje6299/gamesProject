    There have been some sightings

    of avalanches
    and geysers across

    the land. We hope the researchers

    we sent will come
    back soon with

    the missing data.'
  - "<b>Research day 5</b>\nThe researches havent came back,\nit's kind of worrying...
    \n\n"
  - '<b>Research day 6</b>

    Apparently, a strange phenomenon

    has been sighted
    far across to the

    west. It might be the cause of the

    missing researchers.
    If you intend

    to investigate,

    <b>PROCEED WITH CAUTION</b>'
